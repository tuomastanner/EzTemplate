EzTemplate by Tuomas Tanner
- The poor man's content management system

** Usage **
Create a template html file with the following tag somewhere at the start:
<!--eztemplate_templatefilename.html-->

Create editable areas by adding a start tag:
<!--ezstart_areaname-->
End your editable area with the an end tag:
<!--ezend_areaname-->

To create pages based on the template, just copy and rename the template file.
You can then edit the contents inside the editable areas freely.
If you change your template design, just run this tool on the file(s) you've created
and the changes will be magically applied with the editable areas left intact.

You can freely muck around with the non-editable areas in destination file, they will be overwritten on update.
Don't worry: If there are any problems in the update process, an error is shown and the original file is left untouched.

Tip: You can also include path information in the template filename tag, if you want to keep your template
files in a different directory than your other site.
